            Hello, my name is Virgile ESTÈVE, I am 19 years old and I am
            currently a student in the first year of BTEC Higher National
            Diploma. I am passionate about computer science since my youngest
            age, which I started playing and being interested in video games. I
            joined the world of development a few years ago and my biggest wish
            is to invest myself in the development of my skills and abilities,
            with the goal of becoming an accomplished full-stack developer as
            this seems to be my professional calling.

            The BTEC Higher National Diploma (=BTS SIO: Computer Services for
            Organizations in France) is a program of baccalaureate+2 level,
            which trains computer scientists as well gifted for the development
            as for the administration and maintenance of a computer network. The
            BTEC Higher National Diploma is divided into two distinct options:
            Option SISR and Option SLAM. The SISR Option (System and Network
            Infrastructure Solution) aims to train versatile network
            technicians. Graduates of this program have all the necessary skills
            for the management and maintenance of a company's network. The SLAM
            Option (Software Solutions and Business Applications) is a course
            dedicated to web and software development enthusiasts. During these
            two years of study, students learn to write specifications, develop
            applications and ensure their integration into the company's
            computerized systems.

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              During my student years, in high school, I went to two different
              establishments, namely the high school Notre-Dame and high school
              Lycée Saint-Bénigne. In class of second, I was in general course
              without any computer option. It was at this time that I discovered
              the SIG (Information and Management Systems) option in the STMG
              (Sciences and Technologies of Management and Administration)
              course that we could choose in the final year.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I made the choice, which corresponded to my expectations, to
              change school to go to STMG in the first year (with those
              specialities: management, law/economics and management sciences
              and digital).
            </p>
            <p>
              In high school, the SIG option allowed me to learn the basics of
              development through programming languages such as HTML, CSS and
              SQL.
            </p>
            <p>
              I quickly understood the basic principles of these languages
              (except for SQL which is not my first skill) and I invested myself
              very seriously in this field. As part of our final year's final
              oral exam, our group of students created individually our own
              websites using templates and other tools. In our website, we put
              together our UCAS (Parcoursup in France) orientation choice, the
              choice of our company as well as the characterization of the
              company. At the end of my final year of high school, after
              obtaining my baccalaureate, I went to this BTEC Higher National
              Diploma to learn new programming languages and deepen my knowledge
              in order to become a developer.

                Currently, I am continuing my education in front-end languages:
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript and in one of back-end languages: C#.
              </li>
              <li>
                For the time being, my only weakness could be one of the
                back-end languages: SQL, which will be on the program in the
                second year of BTEC Higher National Diploma.
              </li>
              <li>
                I also studied the Python language (back-end), which was part of
                the high school math curriculum, and I'm pursuing this subject
                as part of the BTEC Higher National Diploma (Math Algorithm).

                So far, my only extracurricular experience with development
                language is learning Lua. I am still a beginner in Lua.
